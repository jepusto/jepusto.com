R and Stata packages for calculating cluster-robust variance estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) with small-sample corrections, including the bias-reduced linearization estimator of [Bell and McCaffrey (2002)](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/12-001-x/2002002/article/9058-eng.pdf) and extensions proposed in [Tipton (2015)](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-14616-001), [Tipton and Pustejovsky (2015)](/publication/rve-for-meta-regression/), and [Pustejovsky and Tipton (2016)](/publication/rve-in-fixed-effects-models/).
