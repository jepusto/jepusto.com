An R package implementing several methods of estimating a design-comparable standardized mean difference effect size based on data from a single-case design. Methods include those from Hedges, Pustejovsky, & Shadish ([2012](/publication/SMD-for-SCD), [2013](/publication/SMD-for-MBD)) and [Pustejovsky, Hedges, & Shadish (2014)](/publication/design-comparable-effect-sizes/).
