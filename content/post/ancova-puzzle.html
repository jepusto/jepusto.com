<p>Doing effect size calculations for meta-analysis is a good way to lose your faith in humanity—or at least your faith in researchers’ abilities to do anything like sensible statistical inference. Try it, and you’re surely encounter head-scratchingly weird ways that authors have reported even simple analyses, like basic group comparisons. When you encounter this sort of thing, you have two paths: you can despair, curse, and/or throw things, or you can view the studies as curious little puzzles—brain-teasers, if you will—to keep you awake and prevent you from losing track of those notes you took during your stats courses, back when. Here’s one of those curious little puzzles, which I recently encountered in helping a colleague with a meta-analysis project.</p>
<p>A researcher conducts a randomized experiment, assigning participants to each of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> groups. Each participant is assessed on a variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at pre-test and at post-test (we can assume there’s no attrition). In their study write-up, the researcher reports sample sizes for each group, means and standard deviations for each group at pre-test and at post-test, and <em>adjusted</em> means at post-test, where the adjustment is done using a basic analysis of covariance, controlling for pre-test scores only. The data layout looks like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Group</th>
<th><span class="math inline">\(N\)</span></th>
<th>Pre-test <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></th>
<th>Pre-test <span class="math inline">\(SD\)</span></th>
<th>Post-test <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></th>
<th>Post-test <span class="math inline">\(SD\)</span></th>
<th>Adjusted post-test <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Group A</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(n_A\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_{A}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(s_{A0}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_{A}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(s_{A1}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\tilde{y}_A\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Group B</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(n_B\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_{B}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(s_{B0}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_{B}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(s_{B1}\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\tilde{y}_B\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
<td><span class="math inline">\(\vdots\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the write-up does <em>not</em> provide an estimate of the correlation between the pre-test and the post-test, nor does it report a standard deviation or standard error for the mean change-score between pre-test and post-test within each group. All we have are the summary statistics, plus the adjusted post-test scores. We can assume that the adjustment was done according to the basic ANCOVA model, assuming a common slope across groups as well as homoskedasticity and so on. The model is then
<span class="math display">\[
y_{ig} = \alpha_g + \beta x_{ig} + e_{ig},
\]</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(i = 1,...,n_g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g = 1,...,G\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(e_{ig}\)</span> is an independent error term that is assumed to have constant variance across groups.</p>

<p>That study reported this information for each of several outcomes, with separate analyses for each of two sub-groups (LD and NLD). The text also reports that they used a two-level hierarchical linear model for the ANCOVA adjustment. For simplicity, let’s just ignore the hierarchical linear model aspect and assume that it’s a straight, one-level ANCOVA.</p>

<h3>The puzzler</h3>
<p>Calculate an estimate of the standardized mean difference between group <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and group <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, along with the sampling variance of the SMD estimate, that adjusts for pre-test differences between groups. Candidates for numerator of the SMD include the adjusted mean difference, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{y}_B - \tilde{y}_A\)</span> or the difference-in-differences, <span class="math inline">\(\left(\bar{y}_B - \bar{x}_B\right) - \left(\bar{y}_A - \bar{x}_A\right)\)</span>. In either case, the tricky bit is finding the sampling variance of this quantity, which involves the pre-post correlation. For the denominator of the SMD, you use the post-test SD, either pooled across just groups <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> or pooled across all <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> groups, assuming a common population variance.</p>
<p>Have an idea for how to solve this? Post it in the comments or email it to me. Need the solution because you have a study like this in your meta-analysis? Contact me and I’ll share it with you directly. I’m being coy because I’m teaching meta-analysis next semester, and I feel like this would make a good extra credit problem…</p>
