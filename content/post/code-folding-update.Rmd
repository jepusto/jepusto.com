**UPDATED November 21, 2020**. _Thanks to Allen O'Brien for pointing out a bug in the codefolding code, which led to the last code chunk defaulting to hidden rather than open. Allen sent along a simple fix to the [`codefolding.js`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/static/js/codefolding.js) file._

About a year ago I added a code-folding feature to my site, following an approach developed by [Sébastien Rochette](https://statnmap.com/2017-11-13-enable-code-folding-in-bookdown-and-blogdown/). I recently updated my site to work with the latest version of the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for Hugo, and it turns out that this broke [my code-folding implementation](/code-folding-with-blogdown-academic/). It took a bit of putzing and some help from a freelance web developer to fix it, but it's now working again, and I'm again doing my happy robot dance:

In this post, I'll provide instructions on how to reproduce the approach with the current version of the Academic theme, which is [4.8 (March 2020)](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/updates/v4.8.0/). Credit where credit is due: 

- Sébastien Rochette worked out [the earlier implementation](https://statnmap.com/2017-11-13-enable-code-folding-in-bookdown-and-blogdown/).
- Web developer [Max B.](https://upwork.com/freelancers/~01328c0a21498eac2a) worked out the kinks to get it working with the latest version of Academic. We connected through Upwork. Hire him there if you have web dev work!
- As I've said before, I couldn't write javascript to save my life, and my only contribution here is to write down the instructions.

## Code folding with the Academic theme

1. You'll first need to add the codefolding javascript assets. Create a folder called `js` under the `/static` directory of your site. Add the file [`codefolding.js`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/static/js/codefolding.js).
3. Create a folder called `css` under the `/static` directory of your site. Add the file [`codefolding.css`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/static/css/codefolding.css). This is the css for the buttons that will appear on your posts. 
4. Add the file [`article_footer_js.html`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/article_footer_js.html) to the `/layouts/partials` directory of your site.
5. Add the file [`header_maincodefolding.html`](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/header_maincodefolding.html) to the `/layouts/partials` directory of your site.
6. If you do not already have a file `head_custom.html` in the `/layouts/partials` directory, create it. Add the following lines of code to the file:
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
    {{ if not site.Params.disable_codefolding }}
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ "css/codefolding.css" | relURL }}" />
    {{ end }}
    ```
7. If you do not already have a file `site_footer.html` in the `/layouts/partials` directory, copy it over from `/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials`. Add the following lines of code to it, somewhere towards the bottom (see [my version](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/site_footer.html) for example):
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
    <!-- Init code folding -->
    {{ partial "article_footer_js.html" . }}
    ```
8. If you do not already have the file `page_header.html` in the `/layouts/partials` directory, copy it over from `/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials`. Add the following line of code at appropriate points so that your posts will include the "Show/hide code" button:
    ```{js, eval = FALSE}
     {{ partial "header_maincodefolding" . }}
    ```
    Note that you'll likely need to add it twice due do conditionals in `page_header.html`. For example, [my version of the file](https://github.com/jepusto/jepusto.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/page_header.html) includes the partial at lines 62 and 91.
9. Modify your `params.toml` file (in the directory `/config/_default`) to include the following lines:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ############################
    ## Code folding
    ############################
    
    # Set to true to disable code folding
    disable_codefolding = false
    # Set to "hide" or "show" all codes by default
    codefolding_show = "show"
    # Set to true to exclude the "Show/hide all" button
    codefolding_nobutton = false
    ```

## Using the codefolding parameters

The `params.toml` file now has three parameters that control code folding:

- `disable_codefolding` controls whether to load the code folding scripts on your site. Set it to `true` to disable code folding globally. 
- `codefolding_show` controls whether code blocks will be shown or hidden by default. If your previous posts have lots of code in them, set the default to `show` to minimize changes in the appearance of your site.
- `codefolding_nobutton` controls whether the "Show/hide code" button will appear at the top of posts that include code blocks. Set it to `true` to disable the button but keep the other code folding functionality. 

The above parameters are defaults for your entire site. To over-ride the defaults, you can also set the parameters in the YAML header of any post: 

- Set `disable_codefolding: true` to turn off code folding for the post.
- Set `codefolding_show: hide` to hide the code blocks in the post (as in [this post](/package-downloads/)).
- Set `codefolding_nobutton: true` to turn off the "Show/hide code" button at the top of the post (as in the present post).

I hope these instructions work for you. If not, questions, corrections, and clarifications are welcome. Happy blogging, y'all!
